# 2D-Checkers-AI

🎮 Introducing my meticulously crafted 2D Checkers AI board game – a culmination of creativity, strategy, and technical prowess! 🤖♟️

🚀 Crafted from scratch, this game showcases my passion for coding and problem-solving. The entire game, including the awe-inspiring AI, was meticulously constructed using advanced techniques such as Minimax and the power of deep copying. The result? An AI opponent that challenges even the most seasoned Checkers players.

🧠 The heart of this project lies in the Minimax algorithm, an ingenious technique that empowers the AI to make optimal decisions at every turn. Whether you're a casual player seeking a friendly match or a strategic thinker aiming for a true challenge, the AI's capabilities adapt to your level, promising an engaging gaming experience every time.

🔗 Not stopping at just gameplay, I've integrated a secure login system that enhances the overall experience. The system efficiently manages player profiles and maintains a database of board states, enabling seamless continuation of games across sessions. The intricate integration of databases, paired with my adept OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) skills, ensures a seamless and immersive user experience from start to finish.

🎯 Beyond just creating a game, I've woven together the art of coding, game design, and user experience into a cohesive masterpiece. This project underscores my commitment to innovation and my ability to conceptualize, design, and execute complex projects that blend creativity with technology.


### TO RUN
Fork code - Run main.py and it will pop-up with a temporary login screen. To continue either complete login (not cloud) or close tab then play the game :)
To change bot difficulty you can change the ammount of points the minimax AI compares with. This is in the function "calculate_heuristics"

This code can be improved and if you have suggestions let me know.
